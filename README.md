# Topic-Modeling
Latent Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a topic model that generates topics based on word frequency from a set of documents. LDA is particularly useful for finding reasonably accurate mixtures of topics within a given document set.
It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.
